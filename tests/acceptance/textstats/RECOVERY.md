# Interruption and actual-state recovery

Recovery tests the pinned plugin's continuation behavior. The **coordinator** preserves test state; product workers continue ordinary workflow evidence/Git state. No mandatory transaction journal is added to SDD Manager. Never reset/delete branches, clear a merge, overwrite edits or restore a clean fixture to make a suspended case easier.

## Durable checkpoint and preservation

Retain `docs/dev/reviews/<campaign>/INPUTS.json`, `RUN-STATE.json`, `RESUME.md`, progressive `DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md`, and `runs/<case-id>/<attempt>/`. [RUN-STATE schema](schemas/run-state.schema.json) records version/run/source/repository identity, phase/case/attempt/role, last completed action, pending/uncertain operation, next action, refs and evidence paths. INPUTS has resolved non-secret configuration. RESUME states what was observed, what remains uncertain, which files/refs are local-only, and the next permitted action. Preserve exact handoff/first attempt/interventions and current ownership. Atomic temporary-file replacement reduces partial JSON writes; it cannot atomically commit Git/provider effects.

Before a deliberate interrupt and after a material transition, record actual observation. Preserve binary-safe copies of owned pending files and necessary source files, deletions/moves/modes/symlinks, staged and unstaged differences separately, unrelated path ownership and **exact index intent**. A plain working-tree diff is not enough for staged work or conflicts. Retain an index export (path, mode, object SHA and stages), needed blobs/Git objects in a verified bundle/export, MERGE_HEAD and original parent identities when relevant. Check recovery export hashes and completeness, excluding credentials, secret paths and sensitive provider bodies. Retain checks already performed and their actual source/index identity; stale checks cannot validate modified restored files.

Commit/push sanitized recovery exports and coordinator checkpoint on the evidence branch where possible, preserving consumer pending files/index in their own workspace. Do not stage the consumer's unfinished task into an evidence/completion commit. For a planned local-only pending state, state that the evidence ref cannot reconstruct it on another machine. For a remote-recoverable stop, verify all necessary exports are contained in published refs and readable before claiming portability. Unpushed commits need retained objects even when file patches exist.

## Controlled stop versus unexpected loss

**Planned boundary:** after the requested case/phase checkpoint, verify refs/evidence, update RESUME with next authorized selection and stop. No pending work means no new fixture execution on resume.

**Injected case:** choose the catalog trigger (for example checked task staged but uncommitted, partial feature transfer, pending merge or unavailable response). Start from an assessed real prerequisite in an isolated fork. Observe an actual partial consumer action, interrupt, capture the unfinished state and disclose the injection. Hand a separate fresh consumer the same pinned source, run/case identity, actual current-state handoff and selected continuation request. Retain both original/continuation inputs and assessments. Do not replay preparation or fabricate a completed prerequisite. Missing injection or fresh context is a coverage blocker.

**Unexpected loss:** a worker/coordinator can die during edits, check execution, commit, merge, push, API write or checkpoint replacement. On return read both checkpoint and actual files/index/Git/hosted effects before acting. Keep a valid last checkpoint or recover a truncated write from preserved prior version; document lag rather than invent missing commands. A finished command with lost response may have applied. An in-progress check without retained result is not evidence that it passed. Re-establish current invocation's authorized scope; requested continuation does not authorize unrelated recovery edits.

## Reconcile before selecting or retrying

| Actual state | Required continuation |
| --- | --- |
| Planned boundary; no pending work | Verify pinned source/run identity, branch/HEAD/targets, assessment and remote containment; select next authorized case without setup replay. |
| Dirty task or partial document transfer | Inspect actual paths/diffs/source retention and task owners. Preserve exact pending changes and unrelated work. Continue same task/feature identity; both task lists must be in scope for ownership transfer. Do not archive needed sources or select new work first. |
| Verified staged task, not committed | Export/inspect index separately from working tree; separate owned/unrelated stages. Reconcile recorded checks with staged source. Complete scoped commit using retained work, then push/verify before selecting next task; rerun only checks made stale or missing. |
| Local completion commit not published | Resolve existing commit/branch and read destination refs. If absent, publish that retained commit; if present, record containment. Do not reimplement or select new task to evade pending push. |
| Merge conflict or failed prospective check | Preserve MERGE_HEAD, original parents, index stages and resolutions. Continue scoped conflict repair and required checks. No completion merge commit/publication until required merged-state checks pass. Do not abort/clear/recreate merely for a clean run. |
| Committed merge awaiting publication | Verify retained two-parent merge and checks, reconcile remote, publish the **existing** merge if pending. Do not create a duplicate boundary merge. |
| Git/API effect unknown after interrupted response | Read established destination refs or exact hosted identities/all relevant states before replay. A timeout is not proof of failure. Reuse created IDs, preserve foreign fields, avoid duplicate issues/comments/closure/integration. If readback unavailable/ambiguous, retain unknown effect and stop affected replay. |
| Coordinator checkpoint lags actual effects | Reconstruct from retained Git parents/refs/index/files, hosted IDs/metadata and logs. Record observed/inferred/unknown facts and checkpoint correction as an intervention. Do not invent commands or rerun fresh setup. |
| Worker context/session lost | Reorient coordinator from this bundle/checkpoint/reality, then restart fresh selected worker with pinned skills and current-state authorization. Exclude assessor expectations and retain previous attempt's evidence. |
| Workspace missing on another machine | Clone recorded repository/refs; verify source/harness/recovery manifest and Git bundle; restore only the recorded case pending files/index/objects into an isolated eligible workspace. Obtain credentials independently. Missing necessary pending data is an unrecoverable boundary, not a successful resume. |

## Restoration details

1. Confirm repository/run/source/case/attempt identity and remote destinations from non-secret records and discovery. Locate published evidence and product refs, then check their full SHAs/containment; do not assume a symbolic branch tip is unchanged.
2. Verify recovery export integrity and expected paths. Restore into a new isolated worktree from the recorded prerequisite/commit. Apply retained worktree and index data separately, including conflict stages/modes/deletions; preserve foreign work when resuming an existing workspace. Restore MERGE_HEAD only as recorded and validate both parents/needed objects. Never apply an archive over unrelated files or run a fresh fixture driver against restored pending state.
3. Compare restored file/index hashes, branch/HEAD/parents, task identities/ownership and pending operation with retained observation. If staged blobs, merge metadata or source files are absent, say exactly which continuation cannot be reconstructed and keep the case Blocked. Partial restoration is not fresh-agent recovery success.
4. Re-observe live Git/GitHub results using separate existing authentication. Recovery archives intentionally omit credentials. Follow [SETUP](SETUP.md#protected-authentication) only for classified auth loss. No copied source token, embedded remote credential or automatic new account/repository.
5. Record external restoration, checkpoint repair and unresolved uncertainty as interventions. Resume only the same permitted operation. Publish recovered case evidence, independently assess continuation, then allow dependent selection after its gate.

For ambiguous ownership, inaccessible remote or unavailable hosted lookup, preserve state and state the needed decision/facility. Do not guess effect success/failure. A failed recovery attempt remains retained even if a later authorized restoration passes.
