# Design articulation and incremental-delivery review

## Campaign and scope

- **Campaign:** `004_af715bb`.
- **Starting and reviewed baseline:** `af715bbdc8bc4e5baea8058c7021b34a404e4a36`.
- **Date:** 2026-10-02.
- **Mode:** Focused prompt-driven articulation and strategy review; no separate review plan. Source inspection only, with no independent external research or runtime execution.
- **Objective:** Assess ARCHITECTURE versus DECOMPOSITION, their relationship with SPEC, and PLAN/TASKS separation against a meaningful end-to-end MVP followed by small verifiable increments and early functional/usability decisions.
- **Inspected scope:** Four skill entries (sdd-design, sdd-specify, sdd-plan, sdd-tasks); architecture/decomposition references; system-specification/specification-review references; delivery-plan/plan-review references; task-derivation; modularity and task-hierarchy conventions. Thirteen source files. Other skills were not comprehensively reviewed.
- **Authority:** The prompt defines review criteria. No skill revision is authorized by this review; proposed remedies remain recommendations. This artifact and campaign navigation are persisted separately from the unchanged reviewed sources.

## Assessment

Document ownership is coherent: ARCHITECTURE defines the major structural arrangement and rationale; DECOMPOSITION refines logical component responsibilities and collaborations; SPEC owns observable contracts and acceptance; PLAN owns delivery strategy; TASKS derives executable work. These distinctions are already stated and should be retained.

Articulation is concise, but readers reconstruct the complete comparison across several references. Architecture and decomposition share interfaces, dependency direction, ownership, and invariants at different levels; their granularity and canonical ownership could be explained together. SPEC correctly adds behavioral precision rather than copying design, but traceability and feedback across the three concerns remain mostly implicit.

The larger gap is strategic specificity. PLAN already mentions verifiable increments, a thin working path, objective exits, integration, risks, and human decision gates. Those statements are compatible with the requested strategy but do not require an early meaningful end-to-end MVP, deliberately bounded growth, or explicit usefulness/usability and continue/change/stop decisions. This is a gap against the requested planning objective, not an observed failed implementation.

| Finding | Type | Priority | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-001 | Articulation recommendation | P3 | Open |
| R-002 | Traceability recommendation | P3 | Open |
| R-003 | Strategy gap against prompt objective | P2 | Open |
| R-004 | Strategy gap against prompt objective | P2 | Open |

Priorities express the effect on the requested planning behavior, not reproduced product defects. There are two P2 strategy gaps and three P3 recommendations; no runtime failure or blanket architectural defect is claimed.

## Canonical finding records

### R-001 — Explain structural granularity and ownership together

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Location | sdd-design/references/architecture.md, Document ownership; decomposition.md, Document ownership and interface paragraph; sdd-design/SKILL.md ownership paragraph |
| Observation | Both levels describe responsibilities, dependencies, interfaces, ownership, and invariants. Architecture identifies major blocks; decomposition identifies components within blocks, but the distinction is distributed rather than contrasted directly. Architecture routes detailed behavior to SPEC without expressly distinguishing detailed structural design in DECOMPOSITION in that ownership paragraph. |
| Consequence | A reader may duplicate component interface detail in architecture children or treat decomposition as implementation/file breakdown. Existing prohibitions reduce this risk; no actual duplicate project document was supplied. |
| Remedy | Add one compact concern/ownership comparison: system-wide structure and consequential rationale in ARCHITECTURE; component/subcomponent responsibility, collaboration, and design seams in DECOMPOSITION; exact behavior in SPEC; physical placement in layout. Retain cross-links, not copied canonical definitions. |
| Confidence / recheck | High source confidence. Given a proposed change, a reader should identify its structural owner without relying only on document size or filename. |

### R-002 — Make SPEC traceability and design feedback explicit

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Location | decomposition.md opening and interface paragraph; system-specification.md Root/Focused children; specification review opening paragraphs |
| Observation | Decomposition provides design-level interface shapes and identifies contract details SPEC must settle. SPEC owns public/cross-component/error/data/lifecycle guarantees and end-to-end acceptance. Mapping accepted behavioral contracts to their responsible structural boundaries and propagating a discovered conflict back to design are supported but not presented as one concise relationship. |
| Consequence | Structural descriptions can be repeated as behavioral contracts, or a requirement incompatible with the component model can be treated as merely a specification-writing problem. No supplied project demonstrates either outcome. |
| Remedy | State that SPEC defines the guarantees the selected structure must satisfy, with relevant owner/consumer links. Design describes responsibility/dependency/extension/test seams; SPEC settles observable success/failure and acceptance. Reconcile conflicts through accepted design/requirement decisions. Avoid mandatory one-spec-per-component duplication or a separate mapping artifact. |
| Confidence / recheck | High source confidence. A component-owned behavior and a cross-component guarantee should have clear canonical contract owners and structural links; conflict handling must not silently invent requirements or redesign in SPEC. |

### R-003 — Define a meaningful end-to-end MVP as the initial delivery objective

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Location | sdd-plan/references/delivery-plan.md opening and Establish the strategy step 2; plan review first paragraph |
| Observation | The plan requires verifiable increments but says a new project may need a thin working path. It supplies no default for earliest meaningful user-visible outcome, smallest feasible supported scope, deliberate omissions, minimal necessary architecture realization, or justification for foundational work that delays that path. |
| Consequence | A compliant plan can build subsystems or future infrastructure first while postponing useful end-to-end behavior. This does not violate current wording but fails to establish the requested default strategy. |
| Remedy | Make the first practical milestone a minimal meaningful end-to-end slice, with explicit included/deferred contracts, observable usefulness, minimum necessary dependencies, and rigorous relevant acceptance. Explain justified exceptions such as unavoidable infrastructure, characterization, migration, or a risk probe. Complete intended SPEC/design remain authoritative; MVP scope is a selected implementation subset, not a rewrite of the intended whole. |
| Confidence / recheck | High source confidence. A candidate PLAN must identify its earliest usable path, scope/deferrals, relevant acceptance, and why each prior dependency is necessary; it should not equate a technical skeleton or mocked-only path with a useful MVP. |

### R-004 — Bound functional growth by testability and fault localization

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Location | delivery-plan.md steps 2–4; sdd-tasks/references/task-derivation.md Form tasks steps 1–5; modularity.md item 5 |
| Observation | Verifiable increments, coherent tasks, and integration/failure work are already required. Task sizing emphasizes one or a few related modules. There is no explicit strategy to establish relevant end-to-end/regression checks early and evolve the usable slice through the smallest meaningful functionality additions. |
| Consequence | Individually tidy module tasks can accumulate into large functional jumps or late integration. Small file scope alone does not establish a small behavioral change or narrow failure surface. |
| Remedy | PLAN defines small meaningful capability increments preserving the previously working path, with affected contracts/dependencies and evidence needed before advancement. TASKS derives coherent units within that increment; module focus remains useful without requiring every task to be independently user-visible. Plan relevant regression/failure/integration coverage alongside growth and resolve required failures before adding dependent functionality. Do not claim smaller increments guarantee correctness or universally optimal speed. |
| Confidence / recheck | High source confidence. An increment's behavioral scope and acceptance must be bounded, its retained path testable, and its task set must reach integrated evidence rather than defer it to a distant final phase. |

### R-005 — Give hierarchy boundaries functional/usability decision value

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Location | delivery-plan.md step 3; task-hierarchy.md opening; task-derivation.md milestone/exit coverage |
| Observation | Phase/milestone/task hierarchy and consequential human decision gates are explicit, but usefulness/usability review and decisions to continue, amend scope/design, simplify, or stop are not specified as planning criteria. |
| Consequence | Review gates may become technical completion ceremonies rather than early opportunities to discover an unsuitable product or uneconomic direction. The hierarchy enables such decisions but does not by itself ensure they are planned. |
| Remedy | Phases express major delivery/risk outcomes; milestones expose meaningful integrated capabilities and appropriate review/decision evidence; tasks implement the bounded work. Place early functional/usability feedback at suitable milestones and define the decision being informed. Human-controlled correction, revision, or stopping follows that evidence; do not demand usability trials at every task or authorize automatic steering/bail-out. |
| Confidence / recheck | High source confidence. The MVP and subsequent meaningful checkpoints should identify what can be demonstrated, what evidence addresses usefulness/risk, and which consequential human decision follows. |

## Proposed concise articulation

| Document | Governing question | Canonical concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ARCHITECTURE | What major structure supports the required qualities, and why? | Blocks, system-wide relationships/dependency direction, invariants, extension boundaries, consequential tradeoffs. |
| DECOMPOSITION | Which logical units own each responsibility, and how do they collaborate? | Components/subcomponents, provided/required design-level interfaces, state/lifecycle ownership, collaboration and verification seams. |
| SPEC | What must the system and its observable boundaries guarantee? | Successful behavior, errors, data/lifecycle/nonfunctional constraints, cross-component guarantees, objective acceptance. |
| PLAN | What is the simplest practical delivery path to meaningful working behavior, and how will it grow safely? | MVP slice, staged realization of the accepted design/contracts, bounded capability increments, dependencies, verification and human decision gates. |
| TASKS | What bounded executable work realizes each milestone? | Stable task identities, dependencies, edit scopes, and concrete acceptance/evidence within PLAN's hierarchy. |

Design qualities should follow actual needs and constraints. Extensibility concerns anticipated variation; scalability concerns accepted growth/load targets; testability concerns useful observability and verification seams. These aims do not require building every anticipated capability or generalization into the MVP. SPEC states measurable guarantees where they are requirements; design explains structural support; PLAN stages their practical realization without silently relaxing acceptance.

## Revision handoff and limits

1. Agree the concise ownership/traceability articulation for R-001 and R-002.
2. Codify MVP-first and small meaningful growth as PLAN strategy for R-003 and R-004, retaining justified exceptions and complete intended contracts.
3. Align PLAN review, task derivation, hierarchy guidance, and coordinator handoffs with functional/usability decision gates for R-005. Keep detailed testing strategy with its owner rather than reproducing it in PLAN.
4. If revisions are authorized, create a retained revision plan linking these IDs to actual targets and objective rechecks. No revision plan or source repair is performed by this review.

Only the thirteen listed source files were reviewed substantively. No example consumer project, execution history, runtime behavior, optimal delivery time, empirical fault-localization improvement, or usability outcome was tested. Conclusions distinguish current articulation from the stronger strategy requested in the prompt.
