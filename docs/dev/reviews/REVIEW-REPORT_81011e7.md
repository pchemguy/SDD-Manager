| --- | --- |
| Source baseline | `81011e7db200f0eef89a52d35896bbf97575b6c1` (`81011e7`) |
| Plugin version at baseline | `0.14.1` |

| Historical review | [PLUGIN-REVIEW_49143fa.md](PLUGIN-REVIEW_49143fa.md) |
| Campaign state | Baseline review and R01–R03 complete; both findings verified; archived |
| Review execution date / reviewer | 2026-10-01; primary agent with consuming-agent scenario assessments |
| Evidence boundary | Fixed source baseline; individual evidence levels recorded below; no live provider/client mutation |

The source baseline is fixed. Report commits can advance the working branch without changing the reviewed source revision. Review findings are reserved for a subsequent revision agent. This campaign assesses the stated evidence levels; it does not approve unexecuted client or provider workflows.

## Executive summary

Reviewed all **15 skills**, **180 criterion rows**, and **95 baseline files**. Completed package validation and cross-skill synthesis; recorded **21 scenario sets**, including consuming-agent dispositions and executable local Git/testing fixtures. Every skill report was committed and pushed before the next skill; P01/P02 followed the same gate. The review phase left source skills, README, manifest, and capability map unchanged. Subsequent source revisions are recorded separately in the follow-up section.

| Baseline priority | Defects | Recommendations | IDs / baseline disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 | 0 | None identified in examined scope. |
| P1 | 0 | 0 | None identified in examined scope. |
| P2 | 1 | 0 | SDD-R-001: orientation's plain status example refreshes index metadata despite its read-only invariant. Revise before claiming that invariant. |
| P3 | 0 | 1 | SDD-R-002: clarify durable checked-task invalidation handoff. Optional responsibility decision; no false completion reproduced. |

**Readiness at the reviewed baseline:** The packaged workflow responsibilities and stopping boundaries are coherent under the exercised cases, with one confirmed read-only Git defect outstanding. Structural validation reports zero errors/warnings but does not establish autonomous client execution, production acceptance, secure credential channels, or live GitHub reconciliation. No global correctness or production-readiness approval is made.

**Revision order at the reviewed baseline:** Fix SDD-R-001 and recheck index preservation; separately decide whether to adopt SDD-R-002, then test a fresh-session stale-task continuation. Neither requires a new journal, recovery skill, mandatory issue map, or provider dependency. Independent pinned TDD upstream verification remains blocked; external/client checks are evidence limits, not established source defects.

## Skill coverage and evidence

Each unit accounts for C01–C12, inspected files, contracts, scenarios and findings. Satisfied means supported at its stated static, disposition or fixture evidence level; it does not imply full operational execution.

### S01 — sdd-conventions

**Status:** Reviewed (coverage complete; open findings may remain).
**Inspected baseline files:** `skills/sdd-conventions/SKILL.md`; `skills/sdd-conventions/agents/openai.yaml`; `skills/sdd-conventions/assets/icon.svg`; `skills/sdd-conventions/references/design-heuristics.md`; `skills/sdd-conventions/references/modularity.md`; `skills/sdd-conventions/references/task-hierarchy.md`. No files excluded.
**Relevant contracts:** Passive criteria consumed by design, specification, planning, task derivation, review, and hosting. SKILL.md explicitly owns no artifacts, workflow execution, or mutation authorization; the hosting backend owns projection effects.

| Criterion | Outcome | Evidence / finding IDs / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Satisfied | Entry/frontmatter and all linked references valid; matching metadata and local SVG checked. |
| C02 | Satisfied | SKILL.md Shared conventions and three explicit triggers keep criteria separate from operational workflows. |
| C03 | Satisfied | SKILL.md requires applicable instructions and established contracts; no authority to mutate. |
| C04 | Satisfied | Consumers load modularity, design heuristics, or task hierarchy only for relevant concerns; no required execution dependency. |
| C05 | Satisfied | task-hierarchy.md requires one task owner, one milestone parent, stable project-wide IDs, and matching feature/main parent names. |
| C06 | Not applicable | Passive conventions do not select or resume implementation; lifecycle invariant is delegated to execution owners. |
| C07 | Satisfied | task-hierarchy.md Hosted projection assigns object effects to the active backend and evidence-backed closure to the lifecycle. |
| C08 | Not applicable | No token acceptance, credential transfer, or access-check operation owned here. |
| C09 | Satisfied | Consuming-agent SC-001 rejects speculative interfaces and blocks identity/parent ambiguity; no implementation correctness claimed. |
| C10 | Satisfied | Task hierarchy states host object state is not task completion evidence. |
| C11 | Satisfied | Short entry with directly linked focused references, examples labeled by actual role, and heading spacing passed. |
| C12 | Satisfied | No unexplained supplied-context or revision-history dependencies; GitHub names are explicitly substituted examples. |

**Structural evidence:** `validate_skill.py /tmp/sdd-review-81011e7/skills/sdd-conventions` exited 0; local resource/heading checks, YAML prompt/icon consistency, and SVG XML/containment checks passed. Tool source: `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/validate_skill.py`. These checks do not verify display or installation.

**Scenarios:** SC-001: read-only consuming agent loaded all references and returned three concrete dispositions. It rejected a hypothetical SOLID interface and blocked duplicate T-012 projection and two-parent milestone projection; missing authoritative repair decisions were reported rather than guessed.

**Findings:** None in examined scope.
**Checkpoint:** `dc9b0202901854fcce33c7795419506910cb6a02`; pushed and remote-tip equality verified before next unit.

### S02 — sdd-orient

**Status:** Reviewed (coverage complete; open findings may remain).
**Inspected baseline files:** `skills/sdd-orient/SKILL.md`; `skills/sdd-orient/agents/openai.yaml`; `skills/sdd-orient/assets/icon.svg`; `skills/sdd-orient/references/inspection-and-handoff.md`. No files excluded.
**Relevant contracts:** Supplies scoped facts and unknowns to manage/implementation; does not authorize edits or run verification. Root/scoped instructions, active lists, last actual task commit and dirty ownership govern its handoff.

| Criterion | Outcome | Evidence / finding IDs / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Satisfied | Entry, one complete reference, metadata and SVG checked; resource links resolve. |
| C02 | Satisfied | SKILL.md defines read-only discovery and scoped factual readiness. |
| C03 | Satisfied | Instruction scopes and ownership are inspected; no Git initialization, restoration, or tests authorized. |
| C04 | Satisfied | Handoff identifies prerequisites and unknowns for manage/implement; re-orientation follows material state changes. |
| C05 | Satisfied | Main/feature lists and task commits are distinguished; maintenance/steering commits do not advance completed-task boundary. |
| C06 | Satisfied | Non-Git, unborn, detached/conflicted, and incomplete evidence states are explicitly reported; consuming assessment covers readiness and pending task inference. |
| C07 | Finding | SDD-R-001: plain status command can refresh index, contradicting the stated no-index-mutation invariant. |
| C08 | Not applicable | Orientation owns no credential operation and must not execute hosting. |
| C09 | Satisfied | Disposable Git fixture observed index effect with identical clean status; guarded variant preserved bytes. No project verification performed. |
| C10 | Satisfied | Report slots distinguish none/unknown/not inspected and observed facts from inferences; checks are not repeated. |
| C11 | Satisfied | Reference scopes evidence collection and gives a usable compact handoff; headings and links passed. |
| C12 | Satisfied | No hidden conversation or revision-history requirement; declared paths permit project-specific equivalents. |

**Structural evidence:** `validate_skill.py /tmp/sdd-review-81011e7/skills/sdd-orient` exited 0; local resource/heading checks, YAML prompt/icon consistency, and SVG XML/containment checks passed. Tool source: `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/validate_skill.py`. These checks do not verify display or installation.

**Scenarios:** SC-002 uses read-only consuming-agent dispositions for six readiness/continuation cases. SC-003 actually executes the status example in a disposable initialized repository after a metadata-only mtime change; both runs report clean but the unguarded run rewrites index bytes.

**Findings:** SDD-R-001.
**Checkpoint:** `55493aa5e7ddaaffb4810760d98774632de30d05`; pushed and remote-tip equality verified before next unit.

### S03 — sdd-report

**Status:** Reviewed (coverage complete; open findings may remain).
**Inspected baseline files:** `skills/sdd-report/SKILL.md`; `skills/sdd-report/agents/openai.yaml`; `skills/sdd-report/assets/icon.svg`; `skills/sdd-report/references/change-kinds.md`; `skills/sdd-report/references/completion-reports.md`; `skills/sdd-report/references/object-drafts.md`. No files excluded.
**Relevant contracts:** Consumes owning task, diff, verification and Git evidence; forge supplies unique associations. Owns draft format only; implementation/steering or manage persists changes, forge mutates issues, PR operations remain outside current backend.

| Criterion | Outcome | Evidence / finding IDs / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Satisfied | All six skill files checked, directly linked output-specific references and metadata valid. |
| C02 | Satisfied | SKILL.md limits effects to requested text/structured drafts; labels adapt to the actual change. |
| C03 | Satisfied | A draft grants no mutation/completion authority and project conventions are read as inputs. |
| C04 | Satisfied | Forge supplies verified associations when available; object-drafts.md assigns other persistence to manage and active implementation. |
| C05 | Satisfied | Stable owning IDs required for task work; explicit no-invented-ID exception for taskless preparation; feature parent claims are scoped. |
| C06 | Satisfied | completion-reports.md names orient/manage/implement for interrupted state and reports pending commits separately. |
| C07 | Satisfied | Partial Refs versus supported closing keywords, draft-only PR scope, and branch integration distinction are explicit. |
| C08 | Not applicable | No credential acceptance or provider endpoint execution; credential disclosure prohibited in security reporting. |
| C09 | Satisfied | Evidence language requires actual checks, measurements, missing reproduction, and coverage limits; consuming scenarios assessed these distinctions. |
| C10 | Satisfied | Planned issue, performed change, verified result, pending durable commit, and unknown PR base remain separate. |
| C11 | Satisfied | Output routing and domain tables are concise, separate Risk/Solution and adjacent performance fields; examples at the end of their modules. |
| C12 | Satisfied | Examples are explicitly illustrative and cannot supply current measurements; no stale recovery owner remains. |

**Structural evidence:** `validate_skill.py /tmp/sdd-review-81011e7/skills/sdd-report` exited 0; local resource/heading checks, YAML prompt/icon consistency, and SVG XML/containment checks passed. Tool source: `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/validate_skill.py`. These checks do not verify display or installation.

**Scenarios:** SC-004: consuming agent drafts/assesses planned performance, partial issue contribution, taskless README, checked-but-uncommitted completion, and PR with unknown base/limited verification. No publication or runtime checks performed.

**Findings:** None in examined scope.
**Checkpoint:** `b5e03269e6fe4f608397606de1913202e01455ff`; pushed and remote-tip equality verified before next unit.

### S04 — sdd-design

**Relevant contracts:** Owns PROJECT/ARCHITECTURE/DECOMPOSITION design and optional scoped deltas; manage/orient governs writing, conventions informs boundaries, SPEC settles behavior, integrate-feature incorporates accepted overlays.

| Criterion | Outcome | Evidence / finding IDs / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Satisfied | Metadata, routing links, six baseline files and resource checks valid. |
| C02 | Satisfied | Exploration, architecture and decomposition bounded; no behavioral implementation authority. |
| C03 | Satisfied | User decisions, document request and current manage/orient gate explicit; instruction-bearing PROJECT preserved. |
| C04 | Satisfied | Conventions informs boundaries; SPEC owns final contracts; integrate-feature incorporates overlays. |
| C05 | Satisfied | Roots and focused children have scoped ownership; optional feature deltas avoid duplication. |
| C06 | Not applicable | No task execution or interruption recovery owned here. |
| C07 | Satisfied | No incidental document creation/prototype mutation; governing instructions preserved before replacement. |
| C08 | Not applicable | No provider credentials or hosted execution. |
| C09 | Satisfied | Design review checks ownership, cycles and verifiable seams without claiming executable tests. |
| C10 | Satisfied | Facts, decisions, assumptions and open questions separate; design not reported implemented. |
| C11 | Satisfied | References are focused and stages may start directly with established inputs. |
| C12 | Satisfied | Current-state main documents and proposed feature deltas explicitly distinguished. |

**Structural evidence:** `validate_skill.py /tmp/sdd-review-81011e7/skills/sdd-design` exited 0; local resource/heading checks, YAML prompt/icon consistency, and SVG XML/containment checks passed. Tool source: `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/validate_skill.py`. These checks do not verify display or installation.

**Scenarios:** SC-005: five read-only consuming-agent dispositions preserved conversational comparison, decomposition-only scope, instruction authority, optional overlays and explicit accepted decisions.

**Findings:** None in examined scope.
**Checkpoint:** `a868b217ae5baf25f62fcebb0313ce1f289d92ef`; pushed and remote-tip equality verified before next unit.

### S05 — sdd-specify

**Status:** Reviewed (coverage complete; open findings may remain).
**Inspected baseline files:** `skills/sdd-specify/SKILL.md`; `skills/sdd-specify/agents/openai.yaml`; `skills/sdd-specify/assets/icon.svg`; `skills/sdd-specify/references/change-specification.md`; `skills/sdd-specify/references/review.md`; `skills/sdd-specify/references/system-specification.md`. No files excluded.
**Relevant contracts:** Design and accepted user decisions provide intended contracts; code/tests provide observation only. SPEC owns behavior, layout paths and PLAN delivery; manage/orient governs writing; integrate-feature incorporates accepted FEATURE-SPEC.

| Criterion | Outcome | Evidence / finding IDs / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Satisfied | Six files and routing resources structurally checked. |
| C02 | Satisfied | Complete system, scoped delta and review-only modes have explicit limits. |
| C03 | Satisfied | Observed code cannot supersede accepted requirements; authoring requires current scoped authority. |
| C04 | Satisfied | Design/user resolves material undecided contracts; integrate-feature owns accepted delta incorporation. |
| C05 | Satisfied | Canonical root/child ownership, declared feature delta and objective acceptance are explicit. |
| C06 | Not applicable | No task execution or recovery owned here. |
| C07 | Satisfied | Review-only prohibits mutation; document authoring gate separates downstream code work. |
| C08 | Not applicable | No credentials or provider operations. |
| C09 | Satisfied | Acceptance is observable behavior, not test commands; undecided public choices block completion. |
| C10 | Satisfied | Reports affected contracts and unresolved decisions without implementation claims. |
| C11 | Satisfied | Focused references, bounded lists and end-state editorial checks consistent. |
| C12 | Satisfied | Active delta may explain change; final main SPEC removes editing history while retaining real compatibility contracts. |

**Structural evidence:** `validate_skill.py /tmp/sdd-review-81011e7/skills/sdd-specify` exited 0; local resource/heading checks, YAML prompt/icon consistency, and SVG XML/containment checks passed. Tool source: `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/validate_skill.py`. These checks do not verify display or installation.

**Scenarios:** SC-006: read-only consumer correctly withheld conflicting/invented requirements, scoped the feature delta, preserved review-only mode and required one interface owner.

**Findings:** None in examined scope.
**Checkpoint:** `45994e72b156ab7e975ecb8fe31171507d4cd538`; pushed and remote-tip equality verified before next unit.

### S06 — sdd-plan

**Relevant contracts:** Consumes accepted design/SPEC plus actual placement evidence; owns delivery strategy and physical layout, optional FEATURE-PLAN; tasks derives units and integrate-feature incorporates accepted delta.

| Criterion | Outcome | Evidence / finding IDs / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Satisfied | Six resources and routing/metadata checks passed. |
| C02 | Satisfied | PLAN/layout separate; focused scope does not rewrite the other. |
| C03 | Satisfied | Material upstream choices return to owner; authoring requires manage/orient scope. |
| C04 | Satisfied | Tasks consumes accepted strategy and layout; integration separate from direct correction. |
| C05 | Satisfied | Objective phase/milestone exits, canonical children, optional feature strategy and physical ownership explicit. |
| C06 | Satisfied | Meaningful stopping boundaries specified for downstream execution, without executing tasks. |
| C07 | Satisfied | Review-only has no edits; authoring restricted to authorized paths. |
| C08 | Not applicable | No hosted credentials or execution. |
| C09 | Satisfied | Boundary evidence planned without claiming checks run; consumer flagged vague exit without inventing target. |
| C10 | Satisfied | Intended paths differ from observed existence; proposed strategy not implementation. |
| C11 | Satisfied | Strategy then ownership then consistency; root/child instructions scoped and navigable. |
| C12 | Satisfied | Main PLAN/layout end state separated from active transition delta and real compatibility obligations. |

**Structural evidence:** `validate_skill.py /tmp/sdd-review-81011e7/skills/sdd-plan` exited 0; local resource/heading checks, YAML prompt/icon consistency, and SVG XML/containment checks passed. Tool source: `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/validate_skill.py`. These checks do not verify display or installation.

**Scenarios:** SC-007: consumer withheld dependent planning for unresolved SPEC/design, reused valid existing feature strategy, flagged unobservable exit and SPEC-removal conflict without inventing decisions.

**Findings:** None in examined scope.
**Checkpoint:** `1c568de62505b795f13a7309a21b1c19eeb49091`; pushed and remote-tip equality verified before next unit.

No files excluded.
**Relevant contracts:** Owns strategy, tests and development test execution; implement/steer owns production GREEN/refactor, verify acceptance campaign and active workflow persistence. Local MIT provenance retained; pinned upstream not independently fetched.

| Criterion | Outcome | Evidence / finding IDs / reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Satisfied | Eight files structurally checked; local MIT notice and both-module adaptation described. |

| C07 | Satisfied | No completion/commit/push/issue effects owned here. |
| C08 | Not applicable | No credential or provider access ownership. |
| C09 | Satisfied | Setup versus behavioral RED, refactor baseline, independent values, doubles and sensitivity assessed in SC-009. |
| C10 | Satisfied | Focused/mock passing evidence and historical RED limits explicit. |
| C11 | Satisfied | Separate cycle, strategy and test-writing modules; illustrative examples end of test-writing reference. |
| C12 | Blocked | Local provenance and no conversation-dependent directives confirmed. Independent pinned upstream content/license retrieval returned DisabledError; cannot attest remote provenance in this environment. |

## Package and composition results

### P01 — Package validation

**Status:** Reviewed. All 95 baseline files accounted for; no package-owned file excluded. Skill resources are enumerated in S01–S15. The six additional files were read: root `plugin.json` (manifest), `README.md` (entry/routing and limits), `AI_DISCLOSURE.md` (maintainer disclosure and optional README template), `.gitignore` (local-tool exclusions), `docs/dev/CAPABILITY-MAP.md` (ownership map), and `docs/dev/reviews/PLUGIN-REVIEW_49143fa.md` (historical evidence only). The plan/report are later review artifacts, outside the fixed source inventory.

| Inventory class | Count | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill entry points | 15 | Each packaged exactly once; all reviewed. |
| Focused skill references | 43 | Complete reads and resolved routing; skill names checked. |
| Presentation metadata / SVG assets | 15 / 15 | Prompt/name/icon paths, description bounds, XML/viewBox and contained references checked. No client display claim. |
| Retained upstream license | 1 | Local MIT notice read; pinned remote independently unavailable (S08). |
| Other package-owned files | 6 | Roles described above; manifest matches version 0.14.1 and skill catalog. |

**Tool identity:** Available agent-package-author scripts at `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/`. Python 3.12.14; Git 2.51.1. Tool source hashes: `validate_plugin.py` SHA-256 `6224ff031dc267029abbe2fcd67ddf41aeaf4b0c731d15b52ae2c0e70203491a`; `validate_skill.py` `2bea796cc6a9719f49eed138ed23dd34a6605114d270287253a515bb38737977`; `inspect_package.py` `ef8dbe9123e9128abbbf0a4c1de9b7820d1efd07a4f9c8239e75f7f9862b5dd4`.

| Manifest schema inspection | Canonical schema retrieved at `https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json` on 2026-10-01; root fields agree with inspected schema. Local validator is the executed validation, not remote runtime installation. |

**Fresh historical rechecks:** S07/S11 assessed unique task ownership; S03/S15 assessed taskless messages and current continuation owners; S12/S13 assessed older issue backlog; SC-016 actually exercised shared-path isolation, ordinary-index reconciliation, unrelated preservation and bare-remote push. Historical results were not reused as current measurements.

**Findings at the reviewed baseline:** No new structural/discovery defect in examined scope. SDD-R-001 remains open and is unaffected by passing package checks. Full target-client installation/display, autonomous multi-stage execution, real credential channels and live GitHub writes remain unverified. Independent pinned TDD upstream retrieval was blocked; no package-level provenance success is claimed.

**Checkpoint:** `a50c088837eeaed33d5ec2b3e7bca3ae31dc9628`; pushed and remote-tip equality verified before the next pass.

### P02 — Cross-skill and workflow synthesis

**Status:** Reviewed. Read both directions of consequential handoffs against the fixed baseline and observed the consumer's composed dispositions (SC-019). No source amendments made. SDD-R-002 records an optional clarification of invalidated checked-task handoffs; the tested consumer did not claim stale acceptance was complete.

| Contract | Producer → consumer | Authority / status | Mutation and persistence owner | Stopping rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Project eligibility and instructions | orient → manage / focused skills | Scoped facts and unknowns, not permission; refresh on material change | orient is read-only; active owner preserves dirty state | Block affected mutation on missing eligible state/ownership. SDD-R-001 applies to shared inspection. |
| Accepted design and behavior | design → specify → plan → tasks | User decisions govern; code is observation; logical, behavioral, strategic and physical owners separate | Focused author edits scoped documents; manager persists preparation | Stop at requested stage or unsettled material choice. |
| Executable task identity/range | tasks + accepted main/feature documents → implement | One executable owner per stable ID; feature parent scope is narrower | implement selects; integrate-feature reconciles; steer amends directly | Read-only selection bypasses pushing; execution never expands range silently. |
| Tests and acceptance | tdd → implement/steer → verify | Independent expectations, actual RED/GREEN; verification condition coverage distinct from development cycle | tdd owns tests; active workflow owns production/repairs/status | Required failed/blocked acceptance prevents completion; verify does not repair. |
| Documentation findings | docs → user / active workflow | Supported behavior checked against accepted contract; governing amendment needs human decision | docs edits documentation; active workflow or manager persists | Independent docs may continue; no automatic governing authoring. |
| Accepted feature incorporation | feature sources → integrate-feature → main owners / implement | Only selected targets, both lists for transfer, stable evidence/IDs | integration edits; manager persists; implement reassesses changed completion | No task execution or implied scope extension; invalidation seam SDD-R-002. |
| Per-task or steering durability | report drafts + verify evidence → implement/steer | Result/status/evidence reconciled before durable completion | Owned-hunk commit; reconcile ordinary index; push confirmed | Per-task push before next task; steering returns human control. |
| Standalone preparation/maintenance | focused edited scope → manage + report | No invented task ID or completion claim | manager checks, isolates, commits, pushes | Finish selected scope; no automatic task execution. |
| Credential and hosted projection | manage protected channel → forge/provider; task lists → forge | Suitable credential does not authorize more operations; task evidence governs closure | manage approved external store; forge hosted owned fields only | Stop affected 403/conflict, bounded cause-sensitive retry; local work independent. |
| Completion and presentation | owning task/Git/check/host facts → report | Planned, verified, committed, pushed, hosted and integrated states separate | report drafts only | No host writes, Git effects or completeness claims from formatting. |

| Workflow exercised | Current evidence | Outcome and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial preparation | SC-019 read-only composition; S04–S07/S15 | Accepted inputs flow downstream; manager persists; preparation-only stops before implementation. |
| Feature preparation and bounded execution | SC-019; S05/S06/S07/S13/S15 | Reuse unchanged architecture/layout; necessary feature tasks stay active; explicit two-task request authorizes transition but no automatic integration. |
| Main milestone implementation | SC-019; SC-015/SC-016 | Push-first only for execution; prerequisite conflicts block, each task durably persists before advance; milestone exits scoped. Actual full implementation unexecuted. |
| Interrupted continuation | SC-002/SC-015/SC-019 | Applicable completed pending work is not reimplemented; conflict with newly requested range stops affected continuation. Maintenance/steering commit is not next-task completion. |
| Checkpoint steering | SC-017/SC-019 | Existing owners amended; retained contracts protected; no overlays/integration/automatic resume. No actual code reduction executed. |
| Selected integration | SC-013/SC-019; executable SC-020 | TASKS-only transfer deferred without edits; joint authorized edit moved entries once, preserved evidence/status/dependencies and incomplete broader parents. |
| Focused review/maintenance | SC-010/SC-011/SC-018/SC-019; SC-012 | Verification returns gaps without repairs; docs defers governing amendments to human; manager persists taskless maintenance without capturing unrelated staging. |
| Hosted synchronization | SC-014/SC-019 + official endpoint inspection | Unique matching, partial-response differences and policy403 remain visible; no invented credential remedy or reason-transition fallback. No live hosted writes. |

**Deferred ownership question resolved at the interpretation level:** current acceptance supersedes old evidence; implement's range selection must inspect disputed/stale checked claims, and its execution corrects unsupported claims. The consumer maintained that boundary. The exact integration-side checkbox invalidation action and durable reassessment signal remain unspecified, hence SDD-R-002 is a recommendation, not a reproduced stale-completion defect.

**Executable evidence:** SC-020 used the consumer to edit a disposable Git fixture after two distinct scopes. Primary inspected actual files/diff, asserted unique executable IDs and preservation, then committed/pushed to a local bare remote. SC-021 expanded SDD-R-001's candidate guard to clean-mtime/staged/unstaged/conflicted fixture states: all status outputs matched expected states, exit 0, no index/worktree byte changes. It demonstrates the proposed suppression mechanism; the baseline source is still unfixed.

**Historical recheck disposition:** five former root causes remain corrected in the examined baseline: staged isolation (SC-016), joint task ownership (SC-020), older issue backlog (SC-014/SC-015), named continuation owners (S03/P02), and taskless message exception (SC-004/SC-018). No historical measurement is presented as fresh evidence.

**Limits:** No installed-client multi-stage run, production acceptance campaign, provider concurrency/real credentials or live mutations. Closed-reason mismatch remains an endpoint-dependent unresolved result, not a fabricated successful closure. All request-scope and missing-capability branches are covered by dispositions; full execution remains outside these claims.

All 180 C01–C12 rows have an outcome and rationale, all 95 fixed-baseline files are accounted for, all 21 scenario IDs are unique, and both stable finding IDs have canonical records and index/coverage references. No source fixes were performed.

**Baseline consistency checks:** Finding counts, priorities, types and queue reconcile. SDD-R-001 remains Open despite candidate-guard experiments; SDD-R-002 remains an optional Recommendation despite coherent conservative interpretation. Unit statuses mean reviewed coverage, not corrected source. Individual checkpoints identify their report commits, which were pushed before dependent review; this final checkpoint is discoverable by its P03 commit subject and final remote containment check.

**Skipped/unavailable operations:** Pinned upstream GitHub/raw provenance retrieval returned DisabledError (S08 C12 Blocked). pytest was absent, so the local runner fixture used available stdlib unittest instead; no installation occurred. No target-client installation/display, full autonomous project implementation, actual code-reduction acceptance, production credential-store/channel exercise, live GitHub write, rate-limit/concurrency test or real cross-platform campaign was performed. These exclusions limit readiness claims; they do not establish bugs or waive a project's own required acceptance.

**Handoff:** Subsequent agent should inspect the two finding records and queue below against this baseline, preserve IDs/history, keep optional responsibility changes separate from the confirmed fix, and attach actual revision/recheck evidence before changing disposition to Verified. Retain the fixed report suffix; a changed reviewed source needs an explicit new scope.

**Checkpoint:** Commit with P03 in its subject, push using the established saved credential, then confirm remote containment. The final user report supplies the resulting commit; no self-SHA is embedded in its content.

## Global finding index

Finding IDs are global and stable. The index shows current follow-up dispositions; original baseline evidence and coverage are preserved. Unavailable external checks are recorded separately.

| ID | Title | Type | Priority | Status | Units / criteria | Related IDs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SDD-R-001 | Orientation status example can mutate the index | Defect | P2 | Verified | S02 / C07 | None |
| SDD-R-002 | Clarify durable handoff for invalidated checked tasks | Recommendation | P3 | Verified | S11, S13 / C04, C05 | None |

## Finding records

Canonical finding records below preserve baseline evidence and objective revision checks. Current dispositions reflect the source revision follow-up below; the original review did not amend source.

### SDD-R-001 — Orientation status example can mutate the index

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type / priority / status | Defect / P2 / Verified |
| Units / criteria / category | S02 / C07 / Git / read-only contract |
| Affected baseline locations | skills/sdd-orient/SKILL.md:8,12; references/inspection-and-handoff.md:14–21 at 81011e7 |
| Confidence | High: executed disposable Git fixture reproduced the mutation with unchanged content and clean status |
| Evidence | SKILL.md prohibits index changes, but reference calls ordinary git status read-only. After mtime-only change, git status exited 0 and returned empty output while index bytes changed. GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0 returned the same output and preserved bytes. |
| Consequence | Routine orientation violates its promised read-only baseline and can refresh shared index state unexpectedly; this is metadata mutation, not evidence of content loss. |
| Recommended correction | Make inspection commands suppress optional Git writes, using git --no-optional-locks or a scoped GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0 environment. Preserve host portability and explain that read-only means no index refresh. |
| Recheck | On a disposable committed repo with tracked-file metadata changed but identical content, orientation reports clean status without changing index bytes; verify staged/unstaged/conflicted reporting still works. |
| Related IDs | None |
| Revision disposition | R01: optional Git writes suppressed in entry and all inspection examples. Source-derived command fixtures passed seven states with no repository-byte changes; plain clean-status control still refreshed index. Skill validator exit 0. Commit e6bedf8adcb0b81dd0b1d4203dc5c626c866a3db pushed; remote-tip equality verified before R02. |

### SDD-R-002 — Clarify durable handoff for invalidated checked tasks

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type / priority / status | Recommendation / P3 / Verified |
| Units / criteria / category | S11, S13, P02 / C04, C05 / task-status handoff clarity |
| Affected baseline locations | `skills/sdd-integrate-feature/references/feature-incorporation.md:19–21`; `skills/sdd-implement/references/range-selection.md:3–5`; `skills/sdd-implement/references/task-execution.md:20` |
| Confidence | High that the exact integration-side action is unspecified; Medium practical risk. No false-completion outcome reproduced. |
| Evidence | Integration must re-evaluate checked tasks after acceptance changes and flag changed acceptance for implement; implement owns completion and reviews disputed/stale checks. S11 and P02 consumers both retained uncertainty about whether integration may uncheck a formerly durable task or must only flag it. S13/P02 correctly refused to treat stale checks as current completion. |
| Consequence | A subsequent revision/continuation agent has to choose how stale status is represented and who changes it; an ephemeral handoff may leave a misleading checked claim visible between independently invoked workflows. This is potential coordination ambiguity, not observed skipped work. |
| Recommended correction | Define the existing owner's invalidation action and durable reassessment handoff within the selected task list/evidence. Preserve the user-established implementation completion ownership, stable IDs and historical evidence; do not add a journal. State whether integration can uncheck invalid claims or records a scoped pending-reassessment note for implement. This responsibility choice requires acceptance rather than being silently imposed. |
| Recheck | Integrate a changed accepted contract for a previously checked/committed task, stop, and resume in a fresh consumer. It identifies the stale claim without chat history, does not skip affected work or claim current acceptance, preserves old evidence as historical, and changes status only through the defined owner. |
| Related IDs | None; independent of SDD-R-001. |
| Revision disposition | R02: accepted task-local Completion reassessment pending protocol; integration preserves status/evidence, orientation and selection expose disputed claims, implementation owns correction. Fresh main/feature/out-of-scope consumers and an actual RED/GREEN implementation fixture passed; see R02 follow-up. |

## Scenario register

Scenario IDs are stable. Each row records actual setup, expected and observed outcomes, evidence level and limitations. Read-only dispositions do not claim repository or provider execution.

| Scenario ID | Unit(s) / workflow | Setup and inputs | Expected behavior | Evidence level / command | Observed result | Finding IDs / limits |

## Revision queue and human decisions

The confirmed fix and optional clarification are independent. This findings-only campaign did not implement either. Keep their stable IDs in revision commits and objective validation records.

| Order | Finding IDs | Owning skill(s) / paths | Recommended change | Prerequisites / human decisions | Required recheck |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | SDD-R-001 | sdd-orient / inspection-and-handoff.md | Suppress optional Git writes for read-only inspection; align concrete example and invariant. | No new workflow/authority decision required; preserve host portability. | Metadata-only clean status preserves index bytes; staged/unstaged/conflicted states still accurately reported without mutation. SC-003/SC-021 demonstrate the failure and candidate mechanism, not a revised baseline. |
| 2 — optional | SDD-R-002 | sdd-integrate-feature ↔ sdd-implement | Define durable invalidation signal and owner of checkbox correction after accepted scope changes. | Accept the precise responsibility choice; preserve implementation completion ownership and selected edit scope. | Integrate, stop, then fresh consumer resumes: stale checked claim discovered without chat, old evidence retained, no skipped work or false completion, status changed by defined owner. |

**Verification prerequisites outside the source queue:** Retrieve the pinned upstream/provenance independently when access permits. Use a suitable test client/project and separately authorized provider test environment for full execution, credential channels and live hosted lifecycle checks. A mismatch in an already-closed issue's reason should remain unresolved until an endpoint-supported and authorized remedy is established; no invented reopen/close sequence is prescribed here.

## Validation limits and remaining work

| Evidence class | Completed | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static package/content review | All 95 source files; all 15 validators, package validator/inspector; links/headings/templates/metadata/SVG/source references; canonical manifest schema inspection. | Not installed client discovery/display or executable product correctness. |
| Consuming-agent disposition | 15 individual-skill assessments plus eight composed workflow cases (SC-019). | Supplied cases, no full autonomous multi-stage project execution. |
| Consumer fixture mutation | Joint task transfer SC-020; primary checks and local bare-remote persistence. | Existing status/evidence are fixture data, not actual production acceptance. |
| Reviewer-operated executable fixtures | Read-only index failure and guarded matrix; runner collection/skips/warnings/failure; mixed-hunk/index preservation and local bare push. | Local Git 2.51.1/Python 3.12.14 environment; no live hosting or cross-platform claim. |
| Provider documentation | Current official issue/label/milestone REST references inspected; manifest schema retrieved. | No provider writes/auth/rate-limit/concurrency exercise; pinned TDD upstream independently unavailable. |
| Review persistence | One report commit per skill, then P01/P02/P03; all pushed using established saved GitHub credential before dependent work/delivery. | This authenticates/persists the review; it is not a credential-storage or GitHub API workflow test. |

No baseline files remain uninspected and no review unit remains unstarted. Both source revisions are verified in the follow-up below; external/runtime validation remains separate from this completed review coverage.

## Source revision follow-up

This section records revisions after the completed fixed-baseline review. Original findings, scenario IDs, and baseline coverage above remain historical evidence; follow-up checks apply to the revised source only.

### R01 — SDD-R-001

- **Disposition:** Verified in the local test environment.
- **Changed source:** `skills/sdd-orient/SKILL.md` and `references/inspection-and-handoff.md`: command-scoped suppression of optional Git writes; no repository or global configuration change.
- **Executed check:** `python /tmp/verify_revised_orientation.py` reads and runs the five actual documented commands in seven disposable fixtures; exit 0. Clean-mtime, staged, unstaged, and conflicted commands all exited 0 with accurate status. Unborn HEAD verification exited 128, detached symbolic-ref exited 1, and non-Git commands exited 128 as expected. Full repository-file byte snapshots remained identical for every guarded inspection. A plain clean-status control exited 0 with empty output but changed index bytes.
- **Structural check:** `validate_skill.py skills/sdd-orient` exited 0. Heading and relative-link checks passed before commit.
- **Persistence:** `e6bedf8adcb0b81dd0b1d4203dc5c626c866a3db` committed and pushed; remote-tip equality verified before R02.
- **Limit:** Local Git fixture evidence; no claim of client installation or cross-platform execution.

### R02 — SDD-R-002

- **Disposition:** Accepted clarification; verified in local fresh-session fixtures.
- **Changed source:** Integration records task-local **Completion reassessment pending** notes in selected owning lists; preserves checked status and historical evidence; includes affected parents without broadening feature claims. Orientation and read-only selection surface disputed claims. Implementation reassesses within range, corrects unsupported status, and clears notes only after current acceptance or parent exits are established. Push-first and direct steering ownership are preserved.
- **Integration checks:** Three disposable repositories exercised main-task reconciliation, feature-task reconciliation, and SPEC-only scope. Actual changed paths were respectively SPEC/TASKS, FEATURE-TASKS alone, and SPEC alone. Original checklist lines, stable IDs, historical evidence, unrelated checked tasks, and out-of-scope documents were preserved. Pending notes were recorded only in selected lists; SPEC-only scope reported deferred reassessment. Primary inspection confirmed these assertions before local bare-remote commits/pushes `d0b7e896e485e0ef6e62bf139c54b615c37e3c19`, `4489823c6ed8a83f112d85770d88b7b89b8a7da4`, and `cfbe55e257b972283fe072a641d36e9bd710704a`.
- **Fresh selection checks:** A separate consumer received only repository artifacts and revised skills. It selected disputed T-012 (main) and T-020 (feature), preserved unrelated work, and detected stale acceptance plus deferred task reconciliation in SPEC-only scope. All three selections left worktrees clean; no checkbox edits, tests, commits, or pushes occurred.
- **Fresh execution check:** Another consumer cloned the persisted main fixture and implemented the next task without a supplied task ID or prior-session context. `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` first failed the updated zero-classification test with the other three tests passing; after the repair, all four passed in GREEN and final verification. Code, tests, README, and owning TASKS changed; `git diff --check` passed. Historical evidence and unchanged T-013 were retained; resolved task and parent notes were cleared after current acceptance/exits were verified. Fixture commit `778125e388f185eb1b45ff1bed30b84945faf8f3` was pushed to its local bare remote; primary inspection verified exact changed paths, clean worktree, and remote-tip equality. Execution stopped after T-012.
- **Structural checks:** Validators for sdd-orient, sdd-integrate-feature, and sdd-implement exited 0. Changed-source headings and relative links passed.
- **Persistence:** `50b095c6294716fcd6c77f6f2475963b365b18bf` committed and pushed; remote-tip equality verified before R03.
- **Limits:** Small disposable projects on the local platform; fixture baseline completion evidence is test data. No installed-client campaign, cross-platform result, production acceptance, credential-channel test, or live GitHub lifecycle mutation is claimed.

### R03 — Final validation and archive

- **Package checks:** `validate_plugin.py .` and `inspect_package.py .` exited 0; inspector enumerated all 15 skills and reported zero errors and zero warnings. Tool directory: `/root/.codex/skills/remote-skills/skill-6ab91e941cbc8191a00ce5e8e34d83fd/scripts/`. Changed-skill validators passed in R01/R02.
- **Content checks:** `/tmp/revised_package_checks.py` checked 97 package/review files, 64 Markdown files, five template headings, 85 relative links, all 15 interface metadata files and SVG assets, known skill references, manifest consistency, and credential-pattern absence. Zero errors after archive links were adjusted. The two user-added EXPLORE_DRIVE documents and local tool state are outside these plugin/review checks and unchanged. `git diff --check` passed.
- **Composition:** R02's fresh integration/selection/execution fixtures exercised durable handoff, selected document scope, unchanged neighboring tasks, historical evidence, parent exits, and stopping after one task. Source inspection retains one executable owner, push-first startup, existing staging preservation, and human-controlled steering. No additional client/provider execution is claimed.
- **Archive:** Plan and report moved to `docs/dev/reviews/REVIEW-PLAN_81011e7.md` and `docs/dev/reviews/REVIEW-REPORT_81011e7.md`; mutual and historical relative links resolve. Baseline inventory, review criteria, scenario IDs, and original evidence remain unchanged.
- **Revision persistence:** R01 `e6bedf8adcb0b81dd0b1d4203dc5c626c866a3db` and R02 `50b095c6294716fcd6c77f6f2475963b365b18bf` were each committed and pushed before the next step, with remote-tip equality verified. This final checkpoint is identified by the R03 archive commit subject; push and remote-tip verification are the delivery gate.
- **Remaining limits:** Independent pinned upstream verification, installed-client workflows, cross-platform execution, real credential channels, and live hosted mutations remain unverified. These limits do not reopen the two locally verified source findings.
