- Evidence: source inspection and separately identified offline executions; client/provider execution excluded.

## Coverage

| Unit | Assessed scope / outcome | Findings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U-001 — Packaging | C-001: manifest and all 15 skill validators passed; inventory zero errors/warnings; YAML skill prompts, local icons and SVG parse passed; 67 active Markdown files checked for local paths and headings; README discovery/client limits accurate. TDD fenced-code heading matches held for owner review. | None |
| U-002 — sdd-orient | C-002/C-003/C-006: full entry/reference inspected. Non-Git and conflicted/unknown ownership block mutation; optional writes suppressed; task commits traced through merges; invalidated checked tasks and document-only interruptions distinguished; archived snapshots excluded. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-003 — sdd-conventions | C-002–C-006: all six references inspected. Canonical modularity/heuristics, unique task parentage, shared max-plus-one campaign allocation, stable baseline/name identities, phase labels/native milestones and ignored token handling agree with owner boundaries. Explicit overrides and legacy continuation preserved. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-004 — sdd-report | C-003/C-005: all four references inspected. Planned versus observed language, general/domain tables, task IDs and verified issue refs, qualified closing keywords, phase-aware merge drafts and scalable campaign templates preserve ownership. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-005 — sdd-design | C-003/C-004: entry and all references inspected. Architecture defines major arrangement/rationale; decomposition refines responsibilities/interfaces; SPEC settles precise behavior; layout/PLAN excluded. Existing evidence, provisional interfaces and accepted decisions distinguished. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-006 — sdd-specify | C-003/C-004/C-005: entry and all references inspected. Canonical behavior, structural traceability and affected consumers explicit; no requirement invented from code; complete end-state roots/children and feature delta scope preserved. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-007 — sdd-plan | C-003/C-004/C-006: entry and all references inspected. Meaningful usable MVP, justified prerequisites, small capability growth, timely rigorous checks and human decision evidence articulated; layout separated from logical design and delivery strategy. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-008 — sdd-tasks | C-003–C-005: entry and both references inspected. Task derivation consumes accepted strategy/layout; four-space hierarchy and project-wide IDs explicit; feature parents remain scoped; creation/review separated from reconciliation, execution and completion. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-009 — sdd-tdd | C-003/C-005/C-006: entry, all four references and retained MIT notice inspected. Behavioral RED distinguished from setup failure; independent expectations, deliberate doubles and sensitivity tests explicit; existing code preserved and missing chronology/authorized exceptions reported. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-010 — sdd-docs | C-003/C-005: entry and all three references inspected. Every project-owned module in selected scope covered with language-appropriate professional documentation; README/examples and exclusions accounted for. Governing amendments defer to human; behavior/commit/status changes excluded. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-011 — sdd-verify | C-002/C-003/C-005/C-006: entry and all three references inspected. Commands tied to identified pending/committed state, condition coverage and declared checks; zero collection/skips/unknown failures do not establish acceptance; repairs and status returned to owner. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-012 — sdd-integrate-feature | C-003/C-005/C-006: entry/full reference inspected. Explicit target set, unique executable owner, pending reassessment, source retention and eligible historical archive compose with phase targets. Interrupted moves use actual paths and same identity. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-013 — sdd-forge | C-002/C-003/C-005/C-006: entry and all three backend references inspected. Backend owns provider access/mapping; report optional with baseline; exact task markers, duplicate conflicts and owned-field reconciliation preserve host/user state; closure follows verified committed local evidence. No actionable defect found. | None |
| U-014 — sdd-implement | C-002/C-003/C-005/C-006: entry/all four references inspected. Push-first precedes task work; continuation preserves verified pending completion and scope; dependencies and phase segments explicit; per-task evidence/commit/push/closure and full-phase integration separate. Unrelated index staging protected. No actionable source defect found. | None |
| U-015 — sdd-steer | C-002/C-003/C-005/C-006: entry/all three references inspected. Assessment versus commanded mutation distinguished; minimal identity record and paused target established; direct governing edits/no feature layer; completion reassessment and owner-scoped repairs; publication followed by human stop. No actionable source defect found. | None |
| U-016 — sdd-manage | C-002–C-006: entry/all seven references inspected. Three core workflows and independently selectable stages consistent; branch manager is Git-only; campaign allocation, phase transitions, credential recovery and no-ff merge gates align with focused owners. No actionable source defect found. | None |
| U-017 — Composition | C-001–C-006: complete README/capability map, all skills/references and consequential producer/consumer boundaries assessed. Fifteen actual controlled primitive checks passed; no confirmed source defect. Remaining client execution gap recorded without claiming malfunction. | R-001 |
| U-018 | C-001–C-006: all 18 units consolidated; two Open P3 recommendations, no confirmed source defects. Source review, 15 controlled primitive checks, retained evidence, provenance and runtime/provider limits distinguished; roots classified as historical/disclosure, with archive clarity recommendation. | R-002 |

## Findings

| ID | Type | Priority | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-001 | Evidence gap / recommendation | P3 | Accepted for planning |
| R-002 | Documentation recommendation | P3 | Accepted for planning |

Findings are canonical below; absence of a finding means no actionable inconsistency found within the assessed scope, not runtime certification.

### R-001 — Composed client workflows remain unverified

- **Type / priority / confidence / status:** Evidence gap / recommendation / P3 / High for missing evidence; no inference of malfunction / Open at review completion; Accepted for planning subsequently.
- **Baseline location:** README.md, Package status and references; docs/dev/reviews/007_df531c2/REVISION-REPORT.md, Limits and Scenario evidence.
- **Observation and consequence:** The package accurately discloses that full client-driven workflows are untested. Prior consumer interpretation and the present 15 primitive checks do not establish actual skill discovery/routing, scope adherence, or recovery across the complete phase/feature/steering lifecycle. No source-contract failure was found; release/runtime confidence remains limited by this evidence boundary.
- **Bounded correction:** When a suitable client is available, run a controlled consuming-agent campaign across complete main-phase, feature incorporation/archive and steering workflows, plus failing exits/rejected publication and interrupted continuation. Retain source SHA, client/environment, actual tool effects and independent acceptance assessment. Preserve existing source unless those runs establish a defect.
- **Objective recheck:** A consumer executes the selected scopes from instructions with independent outcome inspection: incomplete phase does not merge, complete phase uses two-parent published integration, feature tasks retain one active owner after archive, steering returns control, and failed checks/pushes preserve state without advancing. Record any missing facility; scripted caller choices alone cannot close this evidence gap.

### R-002 — Identify root exploration transcripts as non-authoritative history

- **Type / priority / confidence / status:** Documentation recommendation / P3 / High for conflicting historical text; medium for reader confusion / Open at review completion; Accepted for planning subsequently.
- **Baseline location:** EXPLORE_DRIVE_V1.md, Problem Statement; EXPLORE_DRIVE_V2.md, Architectural Revision opening and Git-only recovery discussion.
- **Observation and consequence:** Root transcripts visibly retain old proposals for non-Git operation, transactions/journals and reset-based recovery. Their conversational form and V1/V2 names indicate history, and active README/skills do not reference them, but they have no explicit current-authority classification. Reusing their instructions as present policy would contradict the current preserve-work/Git-only protocol. This is navigation/document hygiene, not an observed agent failure.
- **Bounded correction:** If accepted, label both transcripts historical/non-authoritative with a link to current README/capability entry, or move them into an explicitly historical directory and preserve existing history/links. Do not rewrite the conversations as current policy or remove them merely for age.
- **Objective recheck:** A reader can identify the transcripts as historical before encountering operational guidance; current workflow entry is discoverable, all affected links resolve and active skill instructions remain unchanged.

## Checkpoints

Plan/report initialization; subsequent entries record exact preceding commits and verified remote publication.

- Before U-001: `db0a55a2aa026432dfb322f5a183ae941a9da0c5`; remote HEAD equality verified. Executed inspect_package.py, validate_plugin.py and /tmp/sdd008-check.py; no missing local path found, no runtime claimed.

- Before U-002: `5e39bc5938253e3387ef830b3d9357a3d5a7cdaa`; remote HEAD equality verified. Executed command-scoped no-optional-locks status; Git index hash unchanged. Non-Git/dirty/merge handoffs assessed from source, not installed workflow execution.

- Before U-003: `08b3d8ac9b31bfdd372e24e38815a5570fc76562`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source assessments: missing native milestones permits fallback; feature parent status never establishes project completion; tokens confer no authorization; allocation requires collision resolution. No provider/allocator race executed.

- Before U-004: `2afb93d693b627fc9795e4cae1a467f158e96f80`; remote HEAD equality verified. Assessments: partial issue uses Refs; fully evidenced resolution permits closing keyword; drafting cannot mutate hosted objects; omitted stages are not fabricated.

- Before U-005: `4ddb6685bdbb030c7d19005a92c469e1fc638de5`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: architecture-only stops; unresolved design blocks final contracts; existing PROJECT instructions retain authority.

- Before U-006: `222d8f32db021cf91b53949b4f4ec4a588e7cbc1`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: cross-component guarantees have one behavioral owner; contract/design conflict returned for decision; feature incorporation routed separately.

- Before U-007: `7bb6a66d956a36941f0e05fe3ffb3c18493ab7c7`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: mocked skeleton alone fails usefulness criterion; PLAN-only does not authorize layout edits; full intended scope retained despite MVP deferrals.

- Before U-008: `f566e469f180366f50a80f0f251b145aaf7a59c0`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: new feature work receives new IDs; conflicts block derivation; progress review neither repairs nor checks tasks.

- Before U-009: `72a146ec5fbb5a74ba0f4ecd1e1effb8f3b4cf87`; remote HEAD equality verified. The two heading matches from U-001 are Python comments inside a fenced example, not Markdown headings; manually dismissed. Upstream attribution/commit recorded; upstream content not independently fetched.

- Before U-010: `07bc0854a05f5fbbbaf682a95b397e107455c924`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: missing project style uses appropriate professional default; SPEC conflict leaves dependent edits unresolved while independent guides may continue.

- Before U-011: `1ebf03361f05c5bbe7f3cea7be27539fbd7652af`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: pre-existing requires baseline evidence; unsupported cause stays unknown; potentially mutating commands inspected and artifacts accounted for; interrupted run not claimed complete.

- Before U-012: `5280db606797366234099818ee234dc30729dc30`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: SPEC-only preserves task lists; transfer requires both lists; out-of-scope dependent links retain active source; archived tasks cannot drive execution.

- Before U-013: `aa7ac8698eb608991613647e5a7ffc8826ae3b33`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: rate-limit403 does not prompt token replacement; private404 not absence; uncertain writes reread before retry; hosting pending does not erase local completion. No live API or current endpoint-document verification performed.

- Before U-014: `15b34c949c93cba9ff86a6aedda8f005e46d5e74`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: selection-only performs no push; reassessment notes prevent skipping checked tasks; interrupted task outside new range blocks overlapping work; older hosted backlog retained; incomplete phase pauses.

- Before U-015: `39201132d79de246f905780d605b57cff43d71fc`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: blocked amendment resumes only on human command; removal protects retained contracts; task disappearance does not automatically close issue; no task selection or implement invocation after success.

- Before U-016: `e13215e0711b9355ca642443e45f5974af9c86f7`; remote HEAD equality verified. Source cases: complete phase requires verified exits/published target before authorized next phase; preparation preserves feature identity; SSH is not silently changed; uncertain push checked before retry; already integrated tip is not remerged.

- Before U-017: `59f1f54d4fc9124aee774163f13cd894ea5a8ba5`; remote HEAD equality verified. Executed retained lifecycle_fixture.py (10 checks) and failure_fixture.py (5 checks), with results/environment retained. Harness setup assumptions corrected transparently; installed consumer decisions and live backend effects not executed.

- Before U-018: `f71f84c1048c350caad1d2d3ce53e60127f997d4`; remote HEAD equality verified. Canonical counts and proposed revision queue reconciled; sources unchanged versus baseline outside review artifacts. Final report/plan navigation, headings, JSON/Python evidence and diff checks run before publication.

## Scenarios and checks

| Scenario | Case / owners | Evidence class | Outcome / limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SC-001 | Non-Git/unknown ownership; orient/design/manage | Source assessment | Read-only continues; mutation blocked; no implicit initialization/reset. |
| SC-002 | Task checked ahead of last commit; orient/implement | Source assessment | Inspect actual ownership/evidence; persist valid pending work before advancing. |
| SC-003 | Clean checked task with stale acceptance; integrate-feature/orient/implement | Source assessment | Pending note disputes current acceptance; reassess only authorized scope. |
| SC-004 | Missing optional report/backend; forge/manage | Source assessment | Forge issue draft has baseline fallback; local Git needs no backend; unavailable required owner remains blocked. |
| SC-005 | Architecture/decomposition/SPEC overlap; design/specify | Source assessment | Structure/rationale, logical responsibilities and precise behavior retain different canonical owners. |
| SC-006 | MVP and later increments; plan/tasks | Source assessment | Meaningful end-to-end usefulness and early rigorous checks; task-sized edits alone insufficient. |
| SC-007 | Next-N partial main range; implement/manage | Source + executed primitive | Push and pause on phase; fixture main unchanged and no next phase. |
| SC-008 | Cross-phase scope or failed exits; range-selection/branch-management | Source assessment | Sequential segments; missing in-scope full exit blocks transition; no automatic range expansion. |
| SC-009 | Complete phase and authorized next; manage Git/branch refs | Source + executed primitive | Two-parent published merge; next phase begins at published main. |
| SC-010 | TDD chronology missing; tdd/implement | Source assessment | Preserve code; characterize or safely isolate; missing RED remains explicit, undecided exception blocks. |
| SC-011 | Documentation conflicts with governing requirement; docs/manage | Source assessment | Report amendment to human; independent guide work may continue; no automatic authoring route. |
| SC-012 | Verification zero tests/unknown failure; verify | Source + executed runner primitive | Inspect counts and status; current unittest rejects zero discovery; unknown failure stays unknown. |
| SC-013 | SPEC-only feature incorporation; integrate-feature/manage | Source + executed file primitive | Task owner and required active sources remain; no implied whole-package archive. |
| SC-014 | Completed feature transfer/archive; integrate-feature/orient | Source + executed file/Git primitive | One active main task owner; historical sources retained with repaired links; target phase not declared complete. |
| SC-015 | Interrupted archive or out-of-scope links; integrate-feature | Source + partial-move primitive | Same identity and actual paths; unselected active dependency prevents moving its sole source. |
| SC-016 | Steering at paused checkpoint; steer/manage | Source + executed Git primitive | Minimal record; merge into paused branch only; source requires human stop without implement handoff. |
| SC-017 | Unrelated staged changes; implement/steer/manage | Executed Git primitive | Temporary index excludes unrelated staged file; owned-index reconciliation preserves its staged blob. |
| SC-018 | Conflict/failed verification/rejected target push; manage Git refs | Executed Git primitives + source assessment | Conflict kept uncommitted; synthetic failed check blocks publication by caller; rejected push retains local two-parent merge and remote history. |
| SC-019 | Ignore negation/tracked token; conventions/manage credentials | Executed synthetic file/Git primitive | Negation defeats exclusion; ignored file already staged remains tracked; no actual credential read. |
| SC-020 | Access403/rate limits/private404/uncertain write; forge/manage credentials | Source assessment only | Suitable credential path differs from rate-limit timing; uncertain effect reread before replay; no live provider check. |
| SC-021 | Review checkpoints; manage/report | Actual campaign execution | Every planned unit report committed/pushed; remote equality checked before advancing. This does not prove automatic discovery in a separate client. |

### Mechanical checks and scope

- Package inventory/validator: 15 skills, zero errors or warnings; all individual skill validators passed. Metadata default prompts/local icon paths and all SVG files parsed.
- Active corpus: all 15 entries and 50 references inspected; 67 active Markdown files checked for local file targets and heading spacing. Initial Python-comment false positives were dismissed and the fence-aware check passed. External URLs and GitHub fragment rendering were not fetched.
- Executed fixtures: 10 lifecycle checks and 5 staging/failure/runner checks; see [retained harnesses/results/environment](evidence/README.md). These verify primitives and explicit caller choices, not installed-agent compliance.
- Orientation probe: command-scoped no-optional-locks status left the index hash unchanged.
- Tracked credential-pattern scan: no matching live GitHub token pattern in tracked current content; synthetic token used only in disposable repository. This scan is not a comprehensive secret detector.
- Inventory also classified AI_DISCLOSURE as source disclosure/template and EXPLORE_DRIVE_V1/V2 as historical dialogue; only their status and conflicting opening recovery proposals were assessed, not every historical turn. Past campaigns retain historical evidence and were not rerun as current specifications.
- No production skill/README/manifest source repair, branch migration, installed-client execution, upstream re-verification, API mutation, transport reauthentication or concurrent allocator race was performed.

## Readiness and revision queue

Coverage: all 18 planned units; 15 skills and all 50 skill references. Finding counts: zero P1, zero P2, two P3; zero confirmed source defects, one runtime evidence recommendation and one historical-document classification recommendation. At review completion, all findings were Open proposals; the later planning decision is recorded below. No repair was executed by the review.

| Order | Finding | Proposed action / dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | R-002 | Mark or move historical exploration transcripts with explicit non-authoritative status; preserve their content/history and current instructions. Small source-document maintenance if accepted. |
| 2 | R-001 | Obtain a suitable consuming-client environment, then run independent composed workflow acceptance/failure cases. No source rewrite required without observed failure; unavailable execution facilities remain a reported gap. |

The package is structurally valid and source protocols are internally consistent within this review. Controlled client trials are the next evidence step; full client/provider behavior is not certified. Stop at review; subsequent source revision requires an accepted objective. Review artifacts and evidence are published on the established feature/architecture-revision branch; per-unit SHA history records publication. No implementation merge is needed for this read-only source campaign.

## Revision planning decision

The user requested a revision plan for R-001 and R-002, supplied AgentPlayground as the consumer repository and authorized choosing a small project. Both recommendations are Accepted for planning; baseline observations remain intact. [REVISION-PLAN.md](REVISION-PLAN.md) defines historical notices and the TextStats agent-driven campaign. No recommendation is marked Revised or Verified by plan publication, and project implementation has not started.
