## Action and acceptance

V-001 adds portable `homepage` and OpenAI presentation metadata at `extensions.com.openai.interface` in root `plugin.json`. Verify the applicable published portable-schema constraints, the exact requested strings, retained package identity/version, whitespace, and campaign links. Commit and publish the coherent revision; explicitly merge, verify the merged result, and publish the established target.

The [OpenAI package documentation](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins) defines this inline extension; the [submission field reference](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/submission) distinguishes `homepage` from listing `websiteURL`. The [portable schema](https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json) permits object-valued extension namespaces.

Stop after this metadata revision. Installed listing refresh and public-directory submission are separate operations.
